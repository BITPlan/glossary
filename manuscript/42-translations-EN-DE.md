# Translations

Here you find translations of the terms
between English and German (see below) and [German-to-English](#section-translations-DE-EN)
(next section).

Several of these terms are based in the legal and organizational foundations of the iSAQB association (and therefore not related to software architecture).

The following tables are generated[^generateTranslation] from a simple JSON input file, maintained within
this books' open source [Github repository](https://github.com/isaqb-org/glossary).

[^generateTranslation]: The documentation found in https://github.com/isaqb-org/glossary contains all information required to generate the translation tables. Currently, only English and German are supported.
    The translation tables are maintained in JSON format, suggestions for improvements are highly welcome!

A>Please note: This translation table is not supposed to be complete, several English terms will not be translated but preferably used in their original language (e.g. many of the design pattern names).
