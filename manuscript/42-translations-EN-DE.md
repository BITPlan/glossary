# Translations

Here you find translations of the terms
between English and German (see below) and [German-to-English](#section-translations-DE-EN)
(next section).

Several of these terms are based in the legal and organizational foundations of the iSAQB association (and therefore not related to software architecture).

A>Please note: This translation table is not supposed to be complete, several English terms will not be translated but preferably used in their original language (e.g. many of the design pattern names).
