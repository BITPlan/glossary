# Appendix D: About Translations

The [translation](#section-translations) tables are generated
by a small Groovy script from a JSON file,
located in the [public Github repository](https://github.com/isaqb-org/glossary) of this glossary.



## Format of Translation File  

The format is simple list with map entries.

{lang="JSON",linenos=off}
~~~~~~~~
[
  { en: "Appropriateness",
    de: "Angemessenheit"
  },
  { en: "Architectural View",
    de: ["Architektursicht", "Sicht"]
  }
  // many more words...
]  
~~~~~~~~

This file is internally converted to the following Java type:

    Map<String, List<String>>

From that, Leanpub-Markdown is generated, one table per language,
currently German ("de") and English ("en").


## Rules for Translation

1. English is the _master_ language, language code "en"
2. Every entry needs to have an English term.
3. Every entry must have at least a single translation to another language,e.g. from en to de.
4. A term might have a list of translations
in other languages (e.g. en:Tradeoff translates
to de:[Kompromiss, Abw√§gung]
