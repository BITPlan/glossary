### Dependency Inversion Principle

High level (abstract) elements should not depend upon low level (specific) elements. "Details should depend upon abstractions" ([Martin-2003](#ref-martin-2003)). One of the [SOLID  principles](#term-solid-principles), nicely explained by [Brett Schuchert](http://martinfowler.com/articles/dipInTheWild.html), and closely related to the [SDP](#term-stable-dependencies-principle) and [SAP](#term-stable-abstractions-principle).
