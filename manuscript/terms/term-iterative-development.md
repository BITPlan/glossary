### Iterative Development

"Development approach that _cycles_ through development phases,
from gathering requirements to delivering functionality in a working release."
(quoted from [c2-wiki](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?IterativeDevelopment))

  Such cycles are repeated to improve either functionality, quality or both.

  Contrast to the [_Waterfall Development_](#term-waterfall-development).
