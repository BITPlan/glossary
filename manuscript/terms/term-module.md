### Module

(see also [Modular programming](#term-modular-programming))

  1. structural element or building block, usually regarded as a _black box_ with
  a clearly defined responsibility. It encapsulates data and code and
  provides public interfaces, so clients can access its functionality.
  This meaning has first been
  described in a groundbreaking and fundamental paper from David L. Parnas:
  [On the Criteria to be Used in Decomposing Software into Modules](http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc838p/Design/criteria.pdf)
  2. In several programming languages, _module_ is a construct for aggregating
  smaller programming units, e.g. in Python. In other languages (like Java),
  modules are called _packages_.

  3. The CPSA(R)-Advanced Level is currently divided into several modules, which can be learned or taught separately and in any order. The exact relationships between these modules and the contents of these modules are defined in the respective curricula.
