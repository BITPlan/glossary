### Trainer
A trainer is a person who conducts a training course himself, provided that this is carried out within the framework of a accreditation granted to an accredited [training provider](#term-training-provider). Accordingly, accredited training providers may only organise and conduct CPSA training courses with accredited trainers. Only accredited training providers can apply for trainer [accreditations](#term-accreditation).
