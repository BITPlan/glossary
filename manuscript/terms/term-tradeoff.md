### Trade-Off

(syn: compromise). A balance achieved or negotiated between two desired or
required but usually incompatible or contradicting features. For example,
software development usually has to tradeoff memory consumption and runtime
speed.

  More colloquially, if one thing increases, some other thing must decrease.

  Even more colloquially: There is no free lunch. Every quality attribute
  has a price among other quality attributes.
