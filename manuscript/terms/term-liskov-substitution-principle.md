### Liskov Substitution Principle

Refers to object oriented programming: If you use inheritance, do it right:
Instances of derived types (subclasses)
must be completely substitutable for their base types. If code uses a base class,
these references can be replaced with any instance of a derived class
without affecting the functionality of that code.
