### Drawing Tool

A tool to create drawings that can be used in architecture documentation. Example: Visio, OmniGraffle, PowerPoint, etc. Drawing tools treat each drawing as a separate thing, this causes maintenance overhead when updating an element of the architecture that is shown in several diagrams (as opposed to a [Modeling Tool](#term-modeling-tool)).
