### Complexity

"Complexity is generally used to characterize something with many parts where those parts interact with each other in multiple ways."
(quoted from Wikipedia.)

  * _Essential_ complexity is the core of the problem we have to solve, and it consists of the parts of the software that are legitimately difficult problems. Most software problems contain some complexity.

  * _Accidental_ complexity is all the stuff that doesnâ€™t necessarily relate directly to the solution, but that we have to deal with anyway.

  (quoted from [Mark Needham](http://codebetter.com/markneedham/2010/03/18/essential-and-accidental-complexity/))

  Architects shall strive to reduce accidental complexity.
