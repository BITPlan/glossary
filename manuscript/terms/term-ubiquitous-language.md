### Ubiquitous Language
A concept of [Domain-Driven Design](#term-DDD): The ubiquitous language is a language that is structured around the [domain model](#term-domain-model). It is used by all team members to connect all the activities of the team with the software. The ubiquitous language is a living thing that is evolving during a project and will be changed during the whole live cycle of the software.
