### Cohesion

The degree to which elements of a building block, component or module belong together is called [cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_%28computer_science%29).
It measures the strength of relationship between pieces of functionality within a given component. In cohesive systems, functionality is strongly related.
  It is usually characterized as _high cohesion_ or _low cohesion_.
  Strive for high cohesion, because high cohesion often implies reusability,
  low coupling and understandability.
