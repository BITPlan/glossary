### Authentication

Authentication is the process of confirming the claim of an identity by a given
entity. Usually this is done by verifying at least one of the authentication
factors which is known by the system:

 * knowledge (e.g. password)
 * ownership (e.g. security token)
 * inherence (e.g. biometrics)

For a stronger authentication multiple factors can be requested or at least
factors of two categories.
