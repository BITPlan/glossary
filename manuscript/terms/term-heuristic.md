### Heuristic

Informal rule, rule-of-thumb. Any way of problem solving not guaranteed to be optimal,
but somehow sufficient. Examples from [Object-Oriented Design](http://www.vincehuston.org/ood/oo_design_heuristics.html) or [User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).
