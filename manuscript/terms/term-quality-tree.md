### Quality Tree

(syn: quality attribute utility tree).
A hierarchical model to describe product quality:
The root "quality" is hierarchically refined in _areas_ or topics, which itself are refined again. Quality scenarios form the leaves of this tree.

  * Standards for product quality, like [ISO 25010](#term-iso-25010), propose _generic_ quality trees.
  * The quality of a specific system can be described by a _specific_ quality tree (see the example below).
