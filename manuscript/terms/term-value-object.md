### Value Object

Value Object is a building block of [Domain-Driven Design](#term-DDD). ValueObjects do not have a conceptual identity of their own and should be treated as immutable. They are used to describe the state of [entities](#term-entity) and may be composed of other value objects but never of [entities](#term-entity).
