### Repository

In architecture documentation: A place where artifacts are stored before an automatic build process collects them into one consistent document.
In [Domain-Driven Design](#term-DDD): Repository is a building block of [Domain-Driven Design](#term-DDD). A repository hides technical details of the infrastructure layer to the domain layer. Repositories return [entities](#term-entity) that are persisted in the database.
