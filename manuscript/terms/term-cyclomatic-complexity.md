### Cyclomatic Complexity

Quantitative measure, number of independent paths through a program's source code.
It roughly correlates to the number of conditional statements (`if`, `while`) in the code +1.
A linear sequence of statements without `if` or `while` has the cyclomatic complexity of 1.
Many software engineers believe that higher complexity correlates to the number of defects.
