### Traceability

(more precisely: _requirements_ traceability): Document that

  1. all requirements are addressed by elements of the system (forward traceability) and
  2. all elements of the system are justified by at least one requirement
  (backward traceability)

  My personal opinion: If you can, you should avoid traceabiltiy, as it creates
  a lot of documentation overhead.
