### Attack Tree

Formal way to describe different approaches of an attacker to reach certain
goals. The tree is usally structured with the attack goal on top and different
approaches as child nodes. Each approach is likely to have dependencies which
are again listed as child nodes.
The possibiliy of a certain way to attack an IT-system can be analyzed by
assigning additional attributes to each node. Examples could be the estimated
costs of an attack or if an attack approach is possible or not by referencing
countermeasures.
