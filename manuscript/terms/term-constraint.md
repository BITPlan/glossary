### Constraint
A restriction on the degree of freedom you have in creating, designing, implementing or otherwise providing a solution. Constraints are often _global requirements_, such as limited development resources or a decision by senior management that restricts the way you plan, design, develop or operate a system.

Based upon a [definition from Scott Ambler](http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/constraint.htm)
