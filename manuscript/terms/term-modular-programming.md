### Modular Programming

"Software design technique that separates the functionality of a program into independent,
interchangeable _modules_, so that each module contains everything necessary to execute
only one aspect of the desired functionality.

  Modules have _interfaces_ expressing the elements provided and required by the module.
  The elements defined in the interface are detectable by other modules."
   (quoted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming))
