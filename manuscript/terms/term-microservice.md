### Microservice

An architectural style, proposing to divide large systems into small units.
"Microservices have to be implemented as virtual machines, as more light-weight alternatives such as Docker containers or as individual processes. Thereby they can easily be brought into production individually." (quoted from the (free) [LeanPub booklet on Microservices](https://leanpub.com/microservices-primer) by [Eberhard Wolff](http://microservices-book.com))
