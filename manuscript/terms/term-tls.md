### TLS

**T**ransport-**L**ayer-**S**ecurity is a set of protocols to cryptographically
secure the communication of two partys by the means of the
[CIA-triad](#term-cia-triad).
It is widely used for secure communication on the internet and the foundation for HTTPS.

TLS started as an update to its predecessor SSL (Secure Socket Layer) Version
3.0 and should be used now instead of SSL [see RFC7568 "Deprecating Secure
Sockets Layer Version 3.0"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7568).
