D> ###### Comment (Alexander Lorz)
D> Depending on who you ask, some might consider architecture styles a generalization of architecture patterns.
D> That is, "distributed system" is a style while "client-server, CQRS, broker and peer-to-peer" are more specific patterns that belong to this style.
D> However, from a practical point of view this distinction is not essential.
