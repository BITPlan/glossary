### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

"Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to developing software for complex needs by deeply connecting the implementation to an evolving model of the core business concepts." (quoted from [DDDCommunity](http://dddcommunity.org/learning-ddd/what_is_ddd/)). See [Evans-2004](#ref-evans-2004).
