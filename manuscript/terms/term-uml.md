### Unified Modeling Language (UML)

[(UML)](http://uml.org) is a graphical language for visualizing, specifying and documenting the artifacts and structures of a software system.

* For building block views or the context view, use component diagrams, with either components, packages or classes to denote building blocks.
* For runtime views, use sequence- or activity diagrams (with swimlanes). Object diagrams can theoretically be used, but are practically not adviced, as they become cluttered even for small scenarios.
* For Deployment views, use deployment diagrams with node symbols.
