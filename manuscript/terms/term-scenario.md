### Scenario

Quality scenarios document required quality attributes.
They "... are brief narratives of expected or anticipated use of a system from both development and end-user viewpoints." ([Kazman+1996](#ref-kazman-1996))
Thus, they help to describe required or desired qualities of a system in pragmatic and informal manner, yet making the abstract notion of “quality” concrete and tangible.

  * Event/stimulus: Any condition or event arriving at the system
  * System (or part of the system) is stimulated by the event.
  * Response: The activity undertaken after the arrival of the stimulus.
  * Metric (response measure): The response should be measurable in some fashion.

Usually scenarios are differentiated into:

* Usage scenarios (application scenarios)
* Change scenarios (modification or growth scenarios)
* Failure scenarios (boundary, stress, or exploratory scenarios)
