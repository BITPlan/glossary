### Non Functional Requirement (NFR)

Requirements that _constrain the solution_.
Nonfunctional requirements are also known as _quality attribute requirements_
or _quality requirements_. The term NFR is actually misleading, as many of
the _attributes_ involved directly relate to specific system _functions_
(so modern requirements engineering likes to call these things
  _required constraints_).
