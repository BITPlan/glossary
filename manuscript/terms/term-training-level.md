### Training Level
The iSAQBÂ® CPSA education programme is divided into (currently) two Training Levels: *Foundation Level* and
*Advanced Level*. The Training Levels should contain knowledge that builds upon one another. The exact relationships between each other and the contents of the Training Level are defined in the respective curricula (_syllabi_).
