### Service (DDD)

Service is a building block of [Domain-Driven Design](#term-DDD). Services implement logic or processes of the business domain that are not executed by entities alone. A service is stateless and the parameters and return values of its operations are [entities](#term-entity), [aggregates](#term-aggregate) and [value objects](#term-value-object).
