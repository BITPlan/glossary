### Modeling Tool

A tool that creates models (e.g. UML or BPMN models). Can be used to create consistent diagrams for documentation because it has the advantage that each model element exists only once but can be consistently displayed in many diagrams (as opposed to a mere [Drawing Tool](#term-drawing-tool)).
