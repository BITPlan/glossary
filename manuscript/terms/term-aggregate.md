### Aggregate

Aggregate is a building block of [Domain-Driven Design](#term-DDD). Aggregates are complex object structures that are made of [entities](#term-entity) and [value objects](#term-value-object). Each aggregate has a root entity and is regarded as one unit when it comes to changes. An aggregate ensure consistency and integrity of its contained entities with invariants.
