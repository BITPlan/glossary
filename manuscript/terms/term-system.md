### System

Collection of elements (building blocks, components etc)
organized for a common purpose.

In ISO/IEC/IEEE Standards a couple of system definitions are available:

* systems as described in [ISO/IEC 15288]: “systems that are man-made and may be configured with one or more of the following: hardware, software, data, humans, processes (e.g., processes for providing service to users), procedures (e.g. operator instructions), facilities, materials and naturally occurring entities”.

* software products and services as described in [ISO/IEC 12207].

* software-intensive systems as described in [IEEE Std 1471:2000]: “any system where software contributes essential influences to the design, construction, deployment, and evolution of the system as a whole” to encompass “individual applications, systems in the traditional sense, subsystems, systems of systems, product lines, product families, whole enterprises, and other aggregations of interest”.
