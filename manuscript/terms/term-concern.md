### Concern

"A _concern_ about an architecture is a requirement, an objective, a constraint, an intention, or an aspiration a stakeholder has for that architecture." (quoted from [Rozanski+11], chapter 8)

Following ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 a concern is defined as (system) interest in a system relevant to one or more of its stakeholders (as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010).

Note, a concern pertains to any influence on a system in its environment, including developmental, technological, business, operational, organizational, political, economic, legal, regulatory, ecological and social influences.
