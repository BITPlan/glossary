### Context View

Shows the complete system as one [blackbox](#term-blackbox) within its environment, either from a business perspective (_business context_) or from a technical or deployment perspective (_technical context_). 
The context view (or context diagram) shows the boundary between a system  and its environment, showing the entities in its environment (its neighbors) with which it interacts.

Neighbors can either be other software, hardware (like sensors), humans, user-roles or even organizations using the system.

See [Context](#term-context).
