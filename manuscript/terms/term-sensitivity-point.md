### Sensitivity Point

(in qualitative evaluation like ATAM):
Element of the architecture or system influencing several quality attributes.
For example, if one component is responsible for both runtime performance _and_ robustness, that component is a sensitivity point.

Casually said, if you mess up a sensitivity point, you will most often have more than one problem.
