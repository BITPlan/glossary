### Software Quality

(from IEEE Standard 1061): Software quality is the degree to which software possesses a desired combination of attributes. This desired combination of attributes need to be clearly defined; otherwise, assessment of quality is left to intuition.

(from ISO/IEC Standard 25010): The quality of a system is the degree to which the system satisfies the stated and implied needs of its various stakeholders, and thus provides value. These stated and implied needs are represented in the ISO 25000 quality models that categorize product quality into characteristics, which in some cases are further subdivided into subcharacteristics.
