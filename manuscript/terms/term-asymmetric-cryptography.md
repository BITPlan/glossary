### Asymmetric Cryptography

Asymmetric cryptography algorithms are designed that the key which is used for
encryption is different from the key used for decryption. The key for
encryption is called "public-key" the key for decryption is called
"private-key". The public key can be published and used by anyone to encrypt
information only readable by the party owning the private-key for decryption.
See [Schneier, Public-Key Algorithms, page 17](#ref-schneier-1996).

Asymmetric cryptography is fundamental for [PKI](#term-pki) and digital
signatures.
