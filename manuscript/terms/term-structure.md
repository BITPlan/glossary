### Structure

An arrangement, order or organization of interrelated elements in a system.
Structures consist of building blocks (structural elements)
and their relationships (dependencies).

  Structures in software architecture are often used in [architecture views](#term-architecture-view),
  e.g. the [building block view](#term-building-block-view).
  A documentation template (e.g. [arc42](#term-arc42)) is
  a kind of structure too.
