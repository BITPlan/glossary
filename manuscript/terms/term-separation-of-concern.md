### Separation of Concerns (SoC)

Any element of an architecture should have exclusivity and singularity of responsibility and purpose: No element should share the responsibilities of another element or contain unrelated responsibilities.

  Another definition is "breaking down a system into elements that overlap
  as little as possible."

  Famous Edgar Dijkstra said in 1974: “Separation of concerns ... even if not perfectly possible, is the only available technique for effective ordering of one’s thoughts”.

  Similar to the [Single Responsibility Principle](#term-single-responsibility-principle).
