### Concept

Plan, principle(s) or rule(s) how to solve a specific problem.

Concepts are often _cross-cutting_ in a sense that multiple architectural
elements might be affected by a single concept. That means that implementors
of e.g. implementation units (building blocks) should adhere to the corresponding
concept.

Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_.
