### Perspective

A perspective is used to consider a set of related quality properties and concerns of a system.

Architects apply perspectives iteratively to the system's _architectural views_ in order to assess the effects of _architectural design decisions_ across multiple _viewpoints_ and _architectural views_.

[Rozanski+11](#ref-rozanski-2011) associates with the term _perspective_ also activities, tactics, and guidelines that must be considered if a system should provide a set of related quality properties and suggests the following perspectives:

 * Accessibility
 * Availability and Resilience
 * Development Resource
 * Evolution
 * Internationalization
 * Location
 * Performance and Scalability
 * Regulation
 * Security
 * Usability
