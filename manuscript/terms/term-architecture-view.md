### Architecture View

A representation of a system from a specific perspective. Important and well-known views are:

* [Context view](#term-context-view),
* Building block view
* Runtime view
* Deployment view

[Bass+2012] and [Rozanski+11] extensively discuss this concept.

Following ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010, an architecture view is a work product expressing the architecture of a system from the perspective of specific system concerns (as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010).
