### Black Box

View on a [building block](#term-building-block) (or [component](#term-component)) that hides the internal structure.
Blackboxes respect the [_information hiding principle_](#term-information-hiding).
They shall have clearly defined input- and output interfaces plus a precisely formulated
_responsibility_ or _objective_. Optionally a blackbox defines some quality attributes,
for example timing behavior, throughput or security aspects.
