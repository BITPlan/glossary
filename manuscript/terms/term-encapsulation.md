### Encapsulation

Encapsulation has two slightly distinct notions, and sometimes to the combination thereof:

  * restricting access to some of the object's components
  * bundling of data with the methods or functions operating on that data

  Encapsulation is a mechanism for [information hiding](#term-information-hiding).
