### Factory

(Design pattern) In class-based or object-oriented programming, the factory method pattern is a creational design pattern that uses factory methods or factory components for creating objects, without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.

In [Domain-Driven Design](#term-DDD): A factory encapsulates the creation of [aggregates](#term-aggregate), [entities](#term-entity), and [value objects](#term-value-object). Factories work exclusively in the domain and have no access to technical building blocks (e.g. a database).
