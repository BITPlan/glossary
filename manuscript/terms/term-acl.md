### ACL
Access Control Lists are a way to organize and store permissions of
a [principal](#term-principal) for a specific entity. Beside implementations
on an application level a typical example for an ACL is the management of file
permissions on unix based operating systems.

Since ACLs don't scale well on a large base it is common to model access
control based on roles ([RBAC](#term-rbac)).
