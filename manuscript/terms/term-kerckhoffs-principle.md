### Kerckhoffs' Principle

One of the six cryptographic axioms described 1883 in an article "La
cryptographie militaire" by the dutch cryptographer and linguist Auguste
Kerckhoffs. This axiom is still relevant today and therefore refered to as
"Kerckhoffs' Principle".

It describes that a cryptographic method must not need to be kept secret in
order to achive the security of the encrypted messages.

"The enemy knows the system" is another expression coined by the mathematician
Claude Shannon as Shannon's Maxim.
