### Building Block

General or abstract term for all kinds of artifacts from which software is constructed.
Part of the statical structure ([Building Block View](#term-building-block-view))
of software architecture.

  Building blocks can be hierarchically structured - they may contain other (smaller)
  building blocks.

  Some examples of alternative (concrete) names for building blocks:
  Component, module, package, namespace, class,
  file, program, subsystem, function, configuration, data-definition.
