### S.O.L.I.D. principles

SOLID (single responsibility, open-closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation and dependency inversion) is an acronym for some principles
(named by [Robert C. Martin](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod))
to improve object-oriented programming and design. The principles make it more likely that a developer will write code that is easy to maintain and extend over time.
