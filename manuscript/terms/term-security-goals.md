### Security Goals

The goals are the key point of information security. They are a basic set of
information attributes which can be fulfilled or not depending on a systems
architecture and processes.

The most common agreed set of security goals is the so called "CIA triad":

* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Availability

The "Reference Model of Information Assuarance and Security" (RIMAS) extends
this list by Accountability, Auditability, Authenticity/Trustworthiness,
Non-repudiation and Privacy.

These are typical examples for non-functional requirements related to security.

See ["What is Security Engineering - Definitions", page 11](#ref-anderson-2008) or [RMIAS](#ref-rmias-2013).
