### Principal

Principals in a security context are entities which have been authenticated and
can be assigned permissions to. A principal can be a user but for example also
other services or a process running on a system. The term is used in the [Java
environment](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/Principal.html)
and throughout different authentication protocols (see [GSSAPI
RFC2744](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2744) or [Kerberos
RFC4121](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4121)).
