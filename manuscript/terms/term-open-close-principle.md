### Open-Close-Principle (OCP)

"Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification" (Bertrand Meyer, 1998).
In plain words:
To _add_ functionality (extension) to a system, you should _not need to modify_ existing code.
Part of Robin Martins "SOLID" principles for object-oriented systems.
Can be implemented in object oriented languages by interface inheritance, in a more general way as _plugins_.
