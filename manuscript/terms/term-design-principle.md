### Design Principle

Set of guidelines that helps software developers to design and implement better solutions,
where "better" could, for example, mean one or more of the following:

  * low [coupling](#term-coupling).
  * high [cohesion](#term-cohesion).
  * [separation of concerns](#term-separation-of-concern) or adherence to the [Single Responsibility Principle](#term-single-responsibility-principle).
  * adherence to the [Information Hiding](#term-information-hiding) principle.
  * avoid *Rigidity*: A system or element is difficult to change because every change potentially
   affects many other elements.
  * avoid *Fragility*: When elements are changed, unexpected results, defects or otherwise negative consequences
   occur at other elements.
  * avoid *Immobility*: An element is difficult to reuse because it cannot be disentagled from the rest of the system.
