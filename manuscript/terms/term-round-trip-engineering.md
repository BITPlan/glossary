### Round-trip Engineering

"Concept of being able to make any kind of change to a model as well as to the code generated from that model. The changes always propagate bidirectional and both artifacts are always consistent." (quoted from
  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_software_development))

D> In my personal opinion, it does not work in practical situations, only in hello-world-like scenarios, as the inverse abstraction (from low-level sourcecode to higher-level architectural elements) usually involves design-decisions and cannot realistically be automated.

D>Recently I have seen code that originated from DDD where reverse engineering did indeed work.
