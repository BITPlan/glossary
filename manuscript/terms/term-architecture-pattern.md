### Architectural (Architecture) Pattern

“An architectural pattern expresses a fundamental structural organization schema for software systems. It provides a set of predefined sub-systems, specifies their responsibilities, and includes rules and guidelines for organizing the relationships between them” (Buschmann+1996, page 12). Similar to [architecture style](#term-architecture-style).

Examples include:

* Layers
* Pipes-and-Filter
* Microservices
* [CQRS](#term-cqrs)
