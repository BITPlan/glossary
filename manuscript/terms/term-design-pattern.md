### Design Pattern

General or generic reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in design.
Initially conceived by the famous architect [Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander),
the concept of _design patterns_
was taken up by software engineers.

In our opinion, every serious software developer should
know at least some patterns from the pioneering [Gang-of-Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)
book by Erich Gamma ([Gamma+1994](#ref-gamma-1994)) and his three allies.
