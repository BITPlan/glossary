### Qualitative Evaluation

Finding risks concerning the desired quality attributes of a system. Analyzing or
assessing if a system or its architecture can meet the desired or required quality goals.

  Instead of calculating or measuring certain characteristics of systems or architectures,
  qualitative evaluation is concerned with risks, trade-offs and sensitivity points.
