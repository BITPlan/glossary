### Bounded Context

Bounded Context is principle of the strategy design of [Domain-Driven Design](#term-DDD). "A bounded context explicitly defines the context within which a [domain model](#term-domain-model) for a software system applies. Ideally, it would be preferable to have a single, unified model for all software systems in the same domain. While this is a noble goal, in reality it typically fragments into multiple models. It is useful to recognize this fact of life and work with it." (quote from Wikipedia)

"Multiple domain models are in play on any large project. Yet when code based on distinct models is combined, software becomes buggy, unreliable, and difficult to understand. Communication among team members becomes confusing. It is often unclear in what context a model should not be applied. Therefore: Explicitly set boundaries in terms of team organization, usage within specific parts of the application, and physical manifestations such as code bases and database schemas. Keep the model strictly consistent within these bounds, but donâ€™t be distracted or confused by issues outside." (quote from Wikipedia)
