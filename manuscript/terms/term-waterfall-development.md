### Waterfall Development

Development approach "where you gather all the requirements up front, do all necessary design, down to a detailed level, then hand the specs to the coders, who write the code; then you do testing (possibly with a side trip to IntegrationHell) and deliver the whole thing in one big end-all release. Everything is big including the risk of failure." (quoted from the [C2 wiki](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?IterativeDevelopment))
