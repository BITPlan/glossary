### Self Contained System (SCS)

An architectural style, similar to [Microservices](#term-microservice). To quote from the site
[scs-architecture.org](http://scs-architecture.org/):

  "The Self-contained System (SCS) approach is an architecture that focuses on a separation of the functionality into many independent systems, making the complete system a collaboration of many smaller software systems. This avoids the problem of large monoliths that grow constantly and eventually become unmaintainable"
