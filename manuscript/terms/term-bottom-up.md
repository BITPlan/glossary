### Bottom-Up Approach

Direction of work (or strategy of processing) for modeling and design.
Starting with something detailed or concrete,
working towards something more general or abstract.

  "In a bottom-up approach the individual base elements of the
  system are first specified in great detail.
  These elements are then linked together to form larger subsystems." (quote from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design))
