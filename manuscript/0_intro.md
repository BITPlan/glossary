# Introduction

This book contains a glossary of _software architecture terminology_.

It can serve as a reference for preparation for the iSAQB e.V.
 examination 
_Certified Professional for Software Architecture - Foundation Level_©.

Please be aware: This glossary is **not** intended to be a primer or course book
on software architecture, just a collection of definitions (and links to further information).

Furthermore, you find proposals for [translations](#section-translations) 
of the iSAQB terminology,
currently between English and German (and vice-versa).

Finally this book contains numerous [references](#section-references) to books
and other resources, many of which we quoted in the definitions.

**This book is work in progress.** 

Errors or ommissions can also be reported in our issue tracker on
