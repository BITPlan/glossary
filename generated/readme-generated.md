# How to handle generated files

This directory contains several auto-generated markdown files
(gen-tt-DE-EN.md, gen-tt-EN-DE.md aswell as gen-terms-[language-code]).

The first two files contain the translation tables for German and English terms.
The other ones contain the glossary terms available in that language.

Handle them as follows:

1. Compare them to the contents of their counterparts in ../manuscript/generated-dont-edit/

2. If you decide they seem correct, copy or move them over to ../manuscript/generated-dont-edit/


We decided **not** to automate these steps... writing books has to contain some manual processing :-)
